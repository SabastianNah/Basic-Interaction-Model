# Basic-Interaction-Model

1. Written description of the interaction model, including the objective of the interaction

    There are two interaction models that are implemented in the game that was made in Unity. The first interaction model is 
    that the player must stand on the purple trigger/pressure plate in order to complete the objective which is to 
    open the purple door. The second interaction model is the player collecting the apple sprite object in order to complete 
    the objective of beating the game which is shown by a victory screen menu that gives the user the option to quit.


2. Brief write-up on how this interaction model can be used in different parts of the game and why

    The two interaction models that were devised in this game could be placed elsewhere to expand the game's playability. The 
    door opening interaction model could be placed throughout the maze in the game and be placed in a way so that the player must 
    actively search for the trigger/pressure plate. The door mechanism could also be added to enter new scenes/areas after 
    the player crosses the door. adding either of these parts to the game would increase the difficulty of the game and make 
    the game more engaging. The addition of these mechanisms to these different parts can allow the game design principles of 
    Engaging Core Mechanics and Maintain Game Flow and Player Experience respectively.
    The second interaction model, Collecting apples, could be expanded upon by adding a higher goal of the 
    amount of apples you need to achieve victory. The apples themselves could be placed throughout the maze instead and provide an
    added search-like objective. Another part that the second interaction model can be added is after collecting X amount of apples,
    the player could be rewarded with a power-up instead of ending the game. The addition of these mechanisms to these different parts
    allows the game to follow the game design principle of Engaging Core Mechanics and Offer Feedback and Rewards respectively.
